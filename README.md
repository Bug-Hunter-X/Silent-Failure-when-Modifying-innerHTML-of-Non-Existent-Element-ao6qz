# Silent Failure with innerHTML on Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript where attempting to modify the `innerHTML` of an element that does not exist results in a silent failure.  The script runs without throwing any errors, but the intended changes are not reflected in the page.

The bug is highlighted in `bug.html` and the corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.html`.
